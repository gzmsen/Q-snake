Have fun playing our game that combines quantum physics with the classic snake game!

Make sure you have the pygame library installed on your computer.

Another detail is that when changing the source of image and sound files, be careful, the codes may not work.

this game earned a degree in the educational materials category at the QTurkey Hackathon, the planckton group proudly presents!
